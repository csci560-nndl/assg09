# Description

Welcome to our programming assingment on doing generative AI using neural networks.  In this
notebook, you will implement a model that uses an LSTM recurrent layer to generate music.  At the end,
you'll be able to listen to the Jazz solos that your networks generates.

**Instructions:**

- As with the previous assignment, you will need to create the function declarations asked for
  in `src/assg_tasks.py`.  Make sure you use
  [Python Docstrings](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-docstrings/) and are generally
  following [Pep8 Python Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for your code.
- Cells with `### TESTED` comment contain unit tests that are run on your implementation.  You will
  need to uncomment the call to the unit tests, but otherwise need to stay as given in the original
  notebook.
- Likewise since you need to write your declaration of the functions asked for the tasks, don't forget
  to uncomment/add the appropriate `from assg_src include X` statements in both this notebook and
  in the `../src/test_assg_tasks.py`

# Objectives

**You will learn:**

- Apply an LSTM to a music generation task.
- Generate your own jazz music with deep learning.
- Practice using the flexible Keras Functional API to create networks
